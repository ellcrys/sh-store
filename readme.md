### Safehold - Database service for Ellcrys' contract applications.

A database storage service for the Ellcrys smart contract platform. Provides immutability through the omission of update or delete operations and tamper-resistance data structure necessary for contract application state verifications. CockroackDB is the underlying database used. The tamper-resistant data structure is based on [Patchain](https://github.com/ellcrys/patchain). 

This project is still under heavy development. Improved documentation coming soon.
